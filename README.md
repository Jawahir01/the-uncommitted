# 🎭 The Uncommitted

![main-page](documents/images/responsive.png.png)

🧠 CodeConfident Quiz which is friendly reminder that you know more than you think!

This lighthearted coding quiz tackles imposter syndrome head-on by revealing a secret at the end: every answer was correct all along. Through bite-sized programming questions, we help developers:

💡 Challenge self-doubt with instant validation
💻 Reframe mistakes as learning opportunities
🚀 Boost confidence with positive reinforcement

*"Wait... but I thought I was wrong?"* That's the point! Designed to mirror how imposter syndrome distorts our self-perception, this experience ends with a crucial reminder:

✨ "You had the right answers all along - trust your coding instincts!"

Perfect for developers feeling stuck in the "I'm not good enough" loop. Take the quiz, see the truth in the results, and walk away a little more confident in your skills.

    - ### Typography
      - This font stack ("Segoe UI", Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif) represents a cross-platform system font combination designed to ensure consistent typography across operating systems while prioritizing readability
        - Segoe UI: Primary font for modern Windows systems (Windows 10/11, Microsoft apps)
        - Tahoma: Fallback for older Windows systems (Windows XP/7)
        - Geneva: macOS/Linux fallback (pre-installed on Apple systems)
        - Verdana: Universal web-safe font (installed on 99% of devices)
        - sans-serif: Generic fallback to the system's default sans-serif font
      - which is ideal for:
        - Technical documentation (clear hierarchy)
        - Open-source projects (works across all OSes)
        - Long-form content (prevents eye strain)
        - Minimalist designs (avoids flashy typography)
